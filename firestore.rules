/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a mixed security model. User data under `/users/{userId}` is strictly controlled by the owning user.
 * Confession lesson comments are publicly readable, but only authenticated users can create, update, or delete their own comments.
 * @data_structure
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profiles. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - `/confession_lesson_comments/{commentId}`: Stores comments on confession lessons.  Read access is public, but write access is restricted to the comment's author.
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - Users can only access their own profile data.
 * - Listing users is disallowed to prevent data harvesting.
 * - Confession lesson comments are publicly readable to encourage engagement.
 * - Data validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase, focusing on authorization.
