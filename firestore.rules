/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a security model based on user authentication.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profile information. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - `/confession_lesson_comments/{commentId}`: Stores comments on confession lessons. Read access is public, but write access is restricted.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled for privacy.
 * - All write operations require a valid, authenticated user.
 * - Data validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase to allow for flexible schema changes.
 * - Read access to confession lesson comments is public to allow for open discussion.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *   - The `confession_lesson_comments` collection does not explicitly enforce ownership via a dedicated field.
 *   - The current schema of `confession_lesson_comments` includes `userId`, but no corresponding `ownerId` field.
